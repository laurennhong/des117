        <p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by and checking out my site. I don’t know how knowing what I did this past summer benefits you but I’m glad you’re here anyway. 2020 was a crazy year for everyone… like literally everyone’s lives, from your mailman to the president, flipped completely. We all essentially had to learn to live our lives differently, unless you were already a hand sanitizer-obsessed mask enthusiast before the pandemic then life probably didn’t change much for you. Personally, quarantine was a time of self-reflection and growth and it feels messed up to say but I honestly think I needed it. Being forced to stay inside helped me grow tremendously and learn truly what I value in life. I carried these realizations with me into 2021 and said “fuck it”, this year I’m living life to the fullest and letting myself be free. Now looking back on it, the summer of 2021 was truly the most eventful, life-changing, fun, and fulfilling summer I’ve ever had. So, whether you know me or not, I hope you enjoy looking through some of my best memories from the summer of 2021.</p>
