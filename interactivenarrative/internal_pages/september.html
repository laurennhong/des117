                    <p>Bye, bye, mama. Bye-bye sisters. Thank you so much for everything. I will miss you dearly and I will never forget what you've done for me. It’s time to start writing the next chapter, Lauren. New adventures, new people, and new lessons. You’re going to be okay. You’ll be scared, maybe even lost, but you’ll find good people. Bye-bye Diamond Bar, hello Davis.</p>

                    <p>One of the best things about moving in a month early is that Nevaeh and I got to explore DT Davis together and get used to the city. Here we went to Armadillo Music to buy some new records. This is where Nevaeh and I got closer. This is where we started making memories together by going out and eating and going on little adventures together. Days like this made Davis feel more like home.</p>

                    <p>I move in on September 2 and stayed with my family in an Airbnb in Sacramento the day after. I think this perfectly represents how I was feeling. I mess inside and out but get through it. This was a very mentally exhausting period of my life. I just moved 800 miles away from my home and my family was about to leave me alone. But at least the bed was comfy.</p>

                    <p>September was filled with making new friends. Two of them are the wonderful Penny and Stella. This day we all went to the grocery store to get ingredients and materials for a big BBQ we were planning. Penny is the best cook on the planet and we have the same fucking birthday which is wild. Stella and I are now close friends because we have classes together but at this point, she was someone that I wanted to get close to.</p>

                    <p>Bryanna’s birthday was soon but she was going home to celebrate. We’d just met her a couple of days ago but we had to celebrate, so at 9pm we decide to go buy brownie mix. Then we spontaneously invited our neighbors to join us for brownies, ice cream, and strawberries. A spontaneous night full of adventures that bonded us as new roommates. </p>
