                    <p>Road trip! My girlies and I on our way to palm springs for a little getaway road trip. This trip was insanely hot, nonetheless, it was so fun. This was my first ever road trip experience and I’m glad I got to go with my girls. We had so many memorable adventures and we packed every single day with as much stuff as possible.</p>

                    <p>I fed a giraffe! During our palm springs trip, we went to The Living Desert. Never in my life did I think I would be face to face with a giraffe. I find animals so amazing and honestly for the most part, better than humans.  We got to see these three cheetahs that are sisters. Cheetahs! That’s crazy. But, the three of them reminded me of me and my sisters. </p>

                    <p>This is the first time I met my Nevaeh bean! We had never met each otherbut but we decided to spontaneously go on a road trip to Davis together. This was the first time I’d visited Davis and got to explore everything. It’s crazy to think how well we got along right from the moment we met each other and now I can’t imagine my life without the girl.</p>

                    <p>Love me some Gloria. This girl is way more swag than she even knows. An iconic queen. This is us at a cool retro store that sold clothes, jewelry, merchandise, records, and weird trinkets. The vibes in this store were out of this world. It was Gloria’s vibe. We did buy sunglasses from this place.</p>

                    <p>A big appreciation for the sky. This summer she was just absolutely stunning nearly every day. Constantly being amazed by what she offers. This day was Nina and me going from store to store just messing around. We made matching friendship bead bracelets and we also got materials to make resin rings. Take some time to do some grown-up arts and crafts.</p>
