                    <p>Annie, Nina, Robin, and I went to the LACMA museum and got to see the Nara Exhibition. Art makes me so happy and gives the world so much flavor. </p>

                    <p>The Broad Museum and a restaurant in LA with Nina and Gloria. I’ve already memorized all the pieces at the Broad but it was a good refresher since I haven't been since before the pandemic. </p>

                    <p>I was just chilling in the pool when my sister came up to say hey. She then proceeded to get in the pool… fully clothed. We just chilled in the pool, but Zeki kept wanting to play with us.</p>

                    <p>Last road trip of the summer! I’d never been to San Fransisco before so I went with Nina, Matthew, and Annika. This was the best road trip of the summer. I felt so free and independent. It was the four of us in this Airbnb with a hello kitty plushie collection and an entire wall that was a chalkboard. We jampacked every single day with as many activities as possible. </p>

                    <p>Princess Diaries has a special place in my heart. It is the best comfort movie of all time. When I was in San Fransisco I got to visit one of the sets. This is the front of the high school from the movie.  I was so excited and I couldn’t stop smiling. I can’t believe I got to be there. A monumental moment in my life. <br><br>

                <p>This was the last time the girlies went out before I moved. We all got dressed very fancy and went to the beach (of course) and Beverley Hills to eat in a fancy rooftop restaurant. The whole day was filled with excitement and fun. We got to see the sunset and LA city lights come alive.<br><br>
