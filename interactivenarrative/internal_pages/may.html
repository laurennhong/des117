                    <p>For my 19th birthday, I went to the park with my family. We were all walking around, but my sister kept going off course and picking things out of the ground. I was wondering what she was doing, But when we arrived at a park bench she gave me this little bouquet. I didn’t show it but it honestly touched my heart that she did this. I still have it and it still makes me smile. I am very much so grateful to have my sisters. </p>

                    <p>Nina and I went over to Sang’s house and we baked a cake and partook in rebellious activities. The Berry Benson cake was truly an iconic moment for us. The night was filled with baking, late-night walks, and card games. It’s fun to do something different like bake a cake in a friend’s house now and then.</p>

                    <p>The most important day of the year! My mama’s birthday! The most beautiful, smart, amazing woman on the planet. For her birthday we went to a very fancy restaurant in LA. During our dinner, we got into a very deep conversation about my mama’s life and I realized how crazy her life has been as an immigrant woman from a military family. My mama the strongest woman ever. I hope my mama had an amazing day because she deserves the world. </p>
