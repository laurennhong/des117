                    <p>On the Fourth of July, Isabel and I went to DT Brea for dinner then went to watch fireworks. This is one of my favorite outfits of all time. On this day though, I got to hang out with Isabel one on one which I never get to do. It was a needed hangout. <br><br>

                    <p>My girl Annie is one-of-a-kind. She’s a weirdo but in the best way possible. This girl has been in my life since literal birth and she’s someone I know for certain will be at my wedding and my funeral. This day we randomly decided to go to Universal Studio with Nina and Annie’s friend Daniel. </p>

                    <p>Roadtrip #3 for the summer! The girlies took over San Diego for a weekend. The girls and I went to a club/restaurant then drove around the city. This trip was short but honestly one of the best. I love the atmosphere in San Diego because it mixes my two favorite places, the city, and the beach. I want to live there one day. <br><br>

                    <p>Another spontaneous, “hey wanna color at the park”, moment. Nina and I decided to get some coloring books and go to the park to just color. It was quite hilarious because Nina and I drew colored two completely different drawings. She drew this super cute wholesome drawing of buzz lightyear and mine was a black and white artistic UFO. It was very much a perfect representation of our relationship. Another very happy day with Nina. <br><br>

                    <p>As the months passed, worries grew about moving to Davis. My life was delayed by an entire year, which is honestly a good thing because I wasn’t ready to leave home. My chest was starting to feel heavy and I was terrified of the thought of my childhood ending and moving out of my home. I had grown up in this park and this city. It’s all that I’ve ever known and loved. But life has to keep moving and instead of looking at it like something ending, I had to look at it like something beginning.</p>
