                    <p>Nina and I woke up at 5am so we could go to a flower field and watch the sunset. I remember chasing the sunrise only for it to be the foggiest morning in SoCal history. Still, the fog painted the sky white which was a beautiful contrast to the hundreds and hundreds of yellows flowers.<br><br>

                    <p>Annika, Nina, Ashley, and Natalie are my childhood friends. We had yummy sandwiches, cakes, and fruits and we caught each other up on our lives. We were all about to split up in a couple of months to go to college. No matter where I go or move, these girls will always have a special place in my heart.<br><br>

                    <p>Another LA adventure with the bestie miss Nina Kim. I got new red gem rings from Memos in DT Fullerton that matched my jacket perfectly. These photos in front of Trader Joe’s are one of my favorites from the entire summer. We got Ubatuba as per usual and walked around Melrose. The energy LA gives is exciting.<br><br>

                    <p>Beach and dinner date with my girlies. We went to a very fancy restaurant near the beach. As soon as I walked in it was like we were transported to a beautiful fantasy land. As we sat there eating, I could imagine the three of us eating out like this all the time when we all become rich badasses.<br><br>

                    <p>One of the most mundane things that I did throughout my entire summer was go to Nina’s house. We didn’t go anywhere or need to do anything super exciting or fun, but still, it was one of my favorite parts of the summer because we were always laughing like crazy.</p>

                    <p>Three besties laying on the sand at Santa Monica beach eating cake and McDonalds while watching the sunset fall on the ocean. Yes, it indeed was as awesome as it sounds. Before we went to the beach, we went to Target and I bought a new bikini to wear at the beach. We would always end up going to Target and buying new outfits just to wear throughout the day.<br><br>
